<h2>Download and Installation</h2>
Currently, the game runs on window through Visual Studio, the appropriate libraries must be linked, instructions on how to do this via visual studio can be found at https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php
primarily the game can be run on ubuntu and debian-based distributions, install the following libraries running this command on your command line

```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
<h3>Building</h3>
<h4>Unix-like (Linux, BSD etc.)</h4>

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
if you prefer, you can use cmake-gui as it has a nicer interface.

feel free to share your opinion and even edit the code in a way that you think is better, any help is welcome.
